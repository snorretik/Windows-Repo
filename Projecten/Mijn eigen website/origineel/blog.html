        <h1>Exploring CS</h1>
        <p>Hello, it's 6-4-2021 today, a tuesday, and it's 21:45 in my timezone (UTC+1, so Amsterdam is a good reference). I have some spare time left, and I thought maybe it's nice to share something of myself. I'm Niels and I'm 31 years old. I'm trying to teach myself programming. It's just an interest that I have that was sparked by a small course I followed some years ago. Sat idle for a while but picked it up again once I got a place for my own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have switched languages a couple of times after that. C++ and Python, notably. But now I'm at web and I feel like it's a keeper. However I'm also interested in the more theoretical part and I have bought some books about that as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Basically I'm documenting the journey so that through that I can make sure I'm still progressing at a steady rate. It's my way of measuring it somewhat.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So far it looks like I'm heading the direction of going self-taught. However I am still considering going back to school for this. But until then I'm still making progress. Our educational system is a lot more accessible than in the US, most likely. Which is why it is more of a requirement here. There isn't that much experience in my area with self-taught developers, at least probably not as much as in the US. So if I am going to stick to self-taught it's going to be a bit more of a challenge, probably. There is a possibility of doing something else though that could be considered some sort of bootcamp. Definitely worth considering. But I have an interest in it anyway, regardless of whether I turn it into a profession or not.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And I have a small rubber duck on my desk. Well that's about it... thanks for reading and I will see you next time!</p>

        <h1>Exploring CS</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website! This website is still under construction. You can expect a blog and a portfolio section in here soon. The title of my blog is Exploring CS so that's what I'm naming this site at the moment. And I'm still learning HTML/CSS/Javascript at the moment. So I'm probably updating this site a lot with my knowledge up to that point. And experiment a little with different designs. That's basically what I've got planned and I'll update this site accordingly. See you soon!</p>

        <h2>Update:</h2>
        <P>A lot has changed since my last update. But something I also want to change is this website and make it a little more professional.</P>
        <br>
        <p>I had a blog on google blogger I was keeping. However I finished that one, under the assumption I would go back to school and the journey would end right there. However!
        </p>
        <p>I have had to cancel that plan again.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And now I'm reconsidering what I want to do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've rethought the whole motivation that I had for computer science etc. And basically, I am still aware where it all began. That was years ago, and basically I was empty handed back then. I had no applicable skills, or meaningful education. And then I just imagined "Oh I just wish I had turned into a computer geek and could now hack or something for example or at least know the basics of something comparable at least".</p>
        <br>
        <p>And then I thought well why wouldn't I be able to yet? I could st√°rt anyway. Maybe I would be late (was 25 back then lol, more than enough time if you ask me), and yeah. I found these quotes that you need to spend 10000 hours on something to become an expert at that. And I thought maybe I could still pull that off?</p>
        <br>
        <p>One thing led to the other and at some point shortly after that initial idea I had the opportunity to take a sort of bootcamp. As a software tester, but for that we also had to know the basics of programming itsself was the accompanying thought.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, over the years stuff progressed. And gradually I had gotten the impression that cyber security wasn't very beginner friendly is what I could say about it then.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And because of that my interests begin to shift. Towards simple applications (I just wanted to see buttons etc for example for a long time! Quite difficult. Almost everything starts out with console and I couldn't move past that really easily), towards games, then towards browser games and websites in general.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I've gone back. I asked myself one more time what is the core reason why I started with this computer science programming thing? Hacking! That's what got me excited initially!</p>
        <br>
        <p>And what I did just recently was try to search for another few resources on hacking. Communities or something with which you can discuss the topic, and suddenly I found a ton more! Really a ton...(!) more. Both communities, discord servers but also books and other resources! Blogs etc. Loads of stuff</p>
        <br>
        <p>And now I've got that in mind again. I want to finish some of the stuff I was doing right before I quit (basically, in favor of school preparation (which was actually more Math oriented)). There was a game I wanted to make as one of the last goals I had. And before I start with hacking, I just want to see if I can pull it off, as a challenge. Finish what I got started.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But yeah more than enough idea's and inspiration for how to pick it up and continue it again. And as I said, I'll be improving this website really shortly because... I wouldn't be surprised if it has already been a full year it's been in this "scaffolding", it should be going somewhere soon now. So I'll definitely take a look at that! Thanks and I'll keep you updated.</p>

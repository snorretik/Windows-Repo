        <p>Welcome to my recently improved website. The main functionality I want it to have is a blog function. That sort of automatically orders it as well based on date etc, the sort of basic functionality you would expect it to have.
        </p>
        <p>I've titled the website "Exploring CS", but it's probably not going to be limited to that. I have more interests that I could list here, all kind of expanding on the main subject. Obviously Mathematics is related to Computer Science in general, I have a fascination with the subject Math. And CS was kind of initiated through an initial interest in the not so completely legal subject of hacking, but I don't have bad intentions that much at all. It just makes it a little more interesting that you maybe c√≥uld do something exciting with it perhaps!
        </p>
        <p>But I've even taken up drawing for a moment as while, and am very much interested in Pixel Art and everything associated with it. Yeah, I could still talk about all kinds of things. But I expect the main thing to be Computer Science, we'll see to what extent that will stick to that.

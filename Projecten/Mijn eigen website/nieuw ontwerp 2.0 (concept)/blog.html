                <h4>Blog</h4>
                <p>Maybe I can keep it short, I am only satisfied once there is an automatic system in here that sort of orders new blog entries in a history overview (for example by month and then individual days etc). It has to sort of be automated already so I can move on, and start focussing on the content. And get this blog going!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because it's going to be the main feature. It more or less is.</p>
                <br>
                <p>More to come.</p>
                <br>
                <p>-</p>
                <br>
                <p>Okay so, it's getting a little more serious than I expected. I need to resort to using a database for this. I've already been able to work with one, in a very basic way. But it did what it was supposed to do. And it probably isn't going to be that more difficult with this website either.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But it does make me question myself on... how serious do I want this to get? And from now on especially, now that I know it's going to get serious anyway?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Those are the questions that I have in mind.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'll keep this updated of course.</p>

Ruby Odin Project best practices:

Follow the directions closely, and don’t skip over any sections.

Do NOT use sudo unless The Odin Project specifically says to do so. Failing to follow this 
advice can cause a lot of headaches. In some instances, you might see a message in the terminal 
telling you to use sudo and/or to install something with apt. Ignore what the terminal says and 
follow the instructions below.

Copy and paste the commands to avoid typos.

If you stop working on this project partway through and come back to it later, be sure to 
use cd to move back inside your project directory so that the commands will work.
